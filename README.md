## Introduction



## Functions

### Root finding

  * ridders(f, a, b) -- Ridders' method for finding roots of univariate functions
  * brent-dekker(f, a, b) -- root finding using the Brent-Dekker approach

### Polynomials

  * horner(p, x) -- Horner schema returning the value of polynomial p at x
                    and of its derivative p' at x
  * proot(p, x0) -- finds a root of polynomial p near x0 using Newton-Raphson

### Integration

  * trapz(x, y) -- Trapezoidal rule for integrating discrete points
                   (with end point correction terms)

### Miscellaneous

  * agm(a, b) -- algebraic-geometric mean of numbers a, b
  * arc_length(f, a, b) -- arc length of the curve defined by f:[a,b] --> R

### Special functions

  * lambertW(x) -- Lambert W function and its first derivative
  * legendre(n, x) -- Legendre polynomial of order n at x
